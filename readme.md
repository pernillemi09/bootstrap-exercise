# Bootstrap Exercises
This repo contains a collection of exercises to practice working with Bootstrap.  
The exercises are based on existing templates, so you can get experience navigating real code, making changes,
and adding new features.

## Exercises

### Portfolio
Solve these exercises on the template in the `portfolio` folder.

<details>
<summary>#1 Change dummy dropdown to "Projects"</summary>

The dummy item **"Dropdown"** in the main menu should be renamed to **"Projects"**.

The text in parentheses shows the link each item should point to.

<details>
<summary>#2 Change testimonials on about page to be cards</summary>

On the `about.html` page, update the testimonials section to use Bootstrap cards.  
Use the content thatâ€™s already there, but fit it into the structure of the card component.

You can start with the example here:  
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/#example

> [!TIP]
> To center a card, the utility class `m-auto` is often enough.

</details>

<details>
<summary>#3 Add badges to services</summary>

On the `services.html` page, add badges to two service cards:
- A green badge labeled `Popular`
- A blue badge labeled `New`

The badges should be placed in the top-right corner inside the service card.  
Use Bootstrap's badge component and positioning utilities to make it work.
</details>

### Admin
Solve these exercises on the template in the `admin` folder.

<details>
<summary>#4 Add accordion instead of "Daily Sales" and "Users online"</summary>

On the `index.html` page, replace the "Daily Sales" and "Users Online" widgets with a Bootstrap accordion.  
The accordion should have the following 6 sections, and the first one should be open by default:

- Getting Started
- Managing Users
- Understanding Analytics
- Customizing the Dashboard
- Security & Access Control
- FAQs & Troubleshooting

> [!TIP]
> You can use the default accordion content from the documentation - just change the headings.

</details>

<details>
<summary>#5 Add import button in "User Statistics"</summary>

In the "User Statistics" section of `index.html`, add a new button to the left of the existing **Export** button.  
The new button should say **Import**.

- `fa-upload` for the Import button
- `fa-download` for the Export button
</details>

<details>
<summary>#6 Add upgrade modal when clicking "Add Customer"</summary>

On the `index.html` page, clicking the **Add Customer** button should open a modal popup asking the user to upgrade.

The modal should include:
- A title: **Upgrade now**
- Body text: *This feature requires you to upgrade to a Pro version.*
- A **Close** button (secondary style)
- An **Upgrade** button (success style)
- The modal should be vertically centered
</details>

<details>
<summary>#7 Add progress bar</summary>

On the `index.html` page, just above the "User Statistics" widget, add a new row with a Bootstrap progress bar.

- The progress should be at **85%**

> [!TIP]
> Use Bootstrap's spacing utilities to add margin under the new row.

### Build your own
Solve this exercise in the `index.html` file in this folder.

<details>
<summary>#8 Use Bootstrap components to build your own</summary>

Pick and use components from the docs and the examples to build out a full page.  
Don't worry about content, just make a mockup of components you feel fit together.

- https://getbootstrap.com/docs
- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/

Ideas for sections:
- Navigation
- Hero area
- Featured
- Pricing
- Footer

> [!TIP]
> If your editor has red lines under something, make sure to hold your mouse
> over, to see what the error is, and fix the errors before you get more errors.
